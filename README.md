This Jupyter Notebook focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques in Python.

🔍 Project Overview
Fraud detection in credit card transactions is crucial to minimize financial losses and protect customers. This project explores machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

🧠 Key Steps in This Notebook
Data exploration and cleaning

Handling imbalanced data

Feature engineering

Building a machine learning model (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)

Model evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score

📊 Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

📈 Dataset
Public credit card transaction dataset

Contains both legitimate and fraudulent transactions

Imbalanced dataset (fraud cases are rare)

(Note: Replace this with your actual dataset name or link if you used a specific dataset.)

💡 Results
Built a model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions.

Improved model performance using techniques like:

SMOTE / Oversampling

Hyperparameter tuning

Visualized key metrics for model performance.
